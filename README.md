## Introduction

This is my personal website which I use for showcasing my skills and my portfolio of current projects.

## Technologies

This project is written with:

- React
- CSS / SASS
- React Transition Group Library

## Status

Project is: \_finished.

Although I will make additions and changes along the way as my skills and projects change. This website is deployed and considered finished.

## Inspiration

My personal website was my first project, after a while it became clear that it was out of date and relatively basic.

The goal was to create a more lively, animated and engaging site. I chose React to allow easier integration of UI state which in turn has allowed more complex interactive features.
